Contain MATLAB code:
  1. corner detector
  2. match features and outlier rejection using MSAC
  3. compute fundamental matrix using inliers
  4. minimize projection error using nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt solver

In the future, the following features will be added:
  1. implement more advanced nonlinear solvers
  2. convert MATLAB code into C++ code for industrial use
